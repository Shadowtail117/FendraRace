# Fendra Race for Rimworld

Adds the Fendra, a race of small canines, to Rimworld.

Despite their fur, they do very poorly in cold temperatures. To compensate, they can research advanced, form-fitting bodysuits that help them survive harsh weather. Ideologically, Fendra are innate scientists and researchers who focus on the collective good of their society, though they can pack a punch too if need be.

*Fendra are a fictional race created by me (Shadow), and any resemblances to other fictional races are coincidental.*

A big thanks to Yap and their [Leeani Race Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1542414306), as well as Zaljerem and [their continuation of it](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3151216431) for inspiring me to make this mod. Much of my early work was based on the Leeani race mod, and it holds a special place in my heart.

Many thanks to the people in the [Humanoid Alien Races Discord server](http://discord.gg/XMCRj46) for helping me more times than I can count (or deserve).

And of course, a thank you to Tynan and the rest of Ludeon for making such an amazing game. :\]
